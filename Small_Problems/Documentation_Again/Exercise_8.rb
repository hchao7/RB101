a = [5, 9, 3, 11]
puts a.min
puts a.min(2)

=begin
Answer: puts a.min(2)

Reflection: The concept of multiple inheritance inherits
from 2 or more immediate superclasses.
Ruby has "mix-in" modules instead,

Example: The "Enumberable" module is a popular mix-in, and it 
may have the documentation for the min method, rather than the documentation
being in the Array's parent class
